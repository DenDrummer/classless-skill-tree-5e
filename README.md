# Classless Skill Tree 5E
*`classless-skill-tree-5e`*

An attempt at a classless skill tree Foundry addon module for DnD 5E inspired by [The Ugly Goblin](https://www.youtube.com/@TheUglyGoblin).  
Plans to provide tools for GMs to create their own skill trees or recreate existing ones, and for these skill trees to be added to and/or replacing character sheets.  
If given permission, will also include The Ugly Goblin's skill trees as presets.

This module is currently in VERY early stages, so for now you will have to manually download it yourself if you want to play around with it.
