# Classless Skill Tree 5E
*`classless-skill-tree-5e`*

An attempt at a classless skill tree Foundry addon module for DnD 5E inspired by [The Ugly Goblin](https://www.youtube.com/@TheUglyGoblin).

Plans to provide tools for GMs to create their own skill trees or recreate existing ones, and for these skill trees to be added to and/or replacing character sheets.

If given permission, will also include The Ugly Goblin's skill trees as presets, but the intent is to be fully compatible with it regardless.

In the meantime, I recommend giving their explanation video a watch!

This module is currently in VERY early stages, so for now you will have to manually download it yourself if you want to play around with it.
